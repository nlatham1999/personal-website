            <h>About Me</h>
            <p>Hi, name is Nick Latham and I am from Post Falls, Idaho. In the spring of 2021, I graduated Gonzaga 
                University with a Bachelor of Science degree. I majored in Computer Science and a minored in Mathematics.</p>
            <p>Since June 2021 I have been working as an Implementation Consultant with FAST Enterprises</p>
            <p>Before that, during the 2020 summer, I interned at Chief Architect Software</p>
            <p> In my free time, I love to hike and run. During the winter, I also love to ski.</p>
            <p> While I was at Gonzaga, I was a member of the Gonzaga Robotics Club and on the embedded systems team of 
                Gonzaga RoboSub. I also volunteered at Blessings Under the Bridge and volunteered at the saturday math 
                tutoring program at Gonzaga
